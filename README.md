Controls:

- A · Go left
- D · Go right
- Space · Jump/Double Jump
- Shift · Jump to roof

- You can jump to walk on the roof. When you are in that state you cannot jump against the gravity, if you jump you will fall, but you will still be able to use the double jump. 

The ninja sprites are made by us.
