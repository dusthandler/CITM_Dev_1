## Controls:

- A · Go left
- D · Go right
- Space · Jump/Double Jump

###For the next release:
- Shift · Jump to roof

### Debug Functions:

- F1 Start from the very first level
- F2 Sart from the beginning of the current level
- F5 Save the current state
- F6 Load the previous state
- F9 View Colliders
- F10 God Mode

## Innovation:

- You can jump to walk on the roof. When you are in that state you cannot jump against the gravity, if you jump you will fall, but you will still be able to use the double jump. 

## Interesting stuff about how the levels have been designed
